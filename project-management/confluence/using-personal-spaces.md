# Understanding Personal Spaces and Team Spaces

## Spaces Overview
* Spaces are a way of **organising content** in Confluence, similar to drawers in a filing cabinet.
* Spaces can contain **documents**, **images**, **standards**, **processes**, and more.
* Spaces can be **locked** to **control who has access** to the content inside.

## Pages
* Pages hold the content within spaces.
* Pages can include text, images, tables, attachments, and macros.
  * Example: A Website Documentation space can have pages for interface overviews, FAQs, blog posts, and JIRA issues.

## Types of Spaces
### Personal Spaces
* **Control**: Each user has full control over their Personal Space.
* Use Case: Often used as a personal staging area for tasks and content before sharing with a team.
* **Flexibility**: Can be used in any way the user needs without affecting other spaces.

### Team Spaces
* **Scope**: Designed to be site-wide or global across the company's Confluence installation.
* **Access Control**: Can still control who has access, but intended for broader team use.
* **Creation**: Must be created by an Administrator.

## Intent and Usage
* **Personal Spaces**: Intended for individual use, but can be shared with others if desired.
* **Team Spaces**: Intended for team or organisational use, facilitating collaboration and shared content.

## Content in Spaces
* **Commonality**: Both Personal and Team Spaces can contain the same types of content (pages, images, text, etc.).
* **Organisation**: Spaces help organise content by using pages in Confluence.

# Creating a Personal Space

## Overview
* There are two types of spaces in Confluence: `Personal` Spaces and `Team` Spaces.

## Steps to Create a Personal Space
1. **Access**: Go to the top right-hand side of the interface.
2. **Add Personal Space**: Click on "Add Personal Space".
3. **Name the Space**: By default, it will use your name. You can keep it as is or change it.
4. **Create**: Click "Create" to finalise the creation of your Personal Space.

## Finding Your Personal Space
* Navigate to the Home page.
* On the top right-hand side, find and click on your "Personal Space".

<br>

# Navigating our Personal Space

## Accessing Personal Space
* Access your Personal Space from your profile.
* Main navigation for the space is on the left-hand side.

## Navigation Panel
* Use the icon or the left/open bracket keyboard shortcut to expand or collapse the panel.
* Adjust the size of the navigation panel as needed.

## Overview
* The Overview is the default Home page of your Personal Space.
* This page can be customised like any other page in Confluence.

## Blog
* A Blog in Confluence is a special type of page tied to the creation date.

## Space Settings
* Available if you have administrative permissions for the space.
* Manage settings specific to your Personal Space.

## Shortcuts
* Add shortcuts to frequently visited websites or external projects.
  * Example: Link to internal email or external project sites.

## Pages
* Contains all the pages within your Personal Space.
* **Sample Pages**: Confluence automatically creates sample pages when a Personal Space is created.
* **Templates**: Sample pages may use different templates, which will be covered later in the course.

<br>

# Creating Pages in our Personal Spaces

## Creating a Page
Steps:
1. Click the "Create" button or use the keyboard shortcut `c` to create a new page.
2. This takes you to Confluence’s Page Editor.
3. Add a title and body text to your page.

## Using Templates
* **Template Sidebar**: When creating a page, a sidebar appears asking if you want to use a template.
* **Preview Templates**: Hover over templates to see a preview.
* **Selecting a Template**: Choose a template to pre-populate the page with relevant information.
  * Example: Using the To-do list template to quickly create a structured page.

## Promoting Templates
Steps:
1. **Publish Page**: Save and publish your page.
2. **Space Settings**: Go to "Space Settings" and select "Templates".
3. **Promote Template**: Find the desired template (e.g., To-do list) and promote it to the top of the list.
4. **Filter Templates**: Promoted templates appear at the top, making them easier to find.

## Disabling Templates
Steps:
1. Go to "Space Settings" and select "Templates".
2. **Disable Templates**: Disable templates you don’t use to clean up the list.
3. **Result**: Only the enabled templates will show up when creating a new page, simplifying the selection process.

## Tips
* **Efficiency**: Promoting and disabling templates can save time and streamline your workflow.
* **Personal Space**: Customise your Personal Space by managing templates to suit your needs.

<br>

# Controlling who can see our Personal Spaces
* By default, anyone with access to your organisation's Confluence can view your Personal Space.

## Space Settings
* Go to "Space Settings" and then "Space Permissions" to manage access.
* **Groups**: Confluence Administrators can set up Groups to manage access more easily.
  * Example: A group for the marketing team to avoid manually adding each user.
* **Individual Users**: Easier to give access to specific users rather than entire groups.
* **Anonymous Access**: Allows anyone on the internet to see the space without logging in. Recommended to leave off unless necessary.

## Managing Permissions
### Groups
* **Pre-built Groups**: Includes Confluence Admins and Users.
* **Adjusting Access**: Uncheck the view option for groups to restrict access.
* Always remember to **save changes** after adjusting permissions.

### Individual Users
* **Override Group Permissions**: Individual user permissions can override group permissions.
  * Example: Even if all users are restricted, you as the owner still have access.

## Practical Example
* **Testing Access**: Log in as another user to verify changes.
* **Without Access**: The Personal Space is not visible.
* **With Access**: The Personal Space and its pages are visible after enabling view permissions.

<br>

# Deleting a Personal Space
* Once deleted, the information in the space cannot be recovered.

## Steps to Delete a Personal Space
1. Go to "Space Settings".
2. Under **Manage space**, select "Delete" space.
3. Confluence will prompt you to **confirm** the deletion.
   * **Warning**: There is no recycle bin or trash; once deleted, the data is permanently lost.
   * Consider archiving the space if you are not 100% sure about deleting it.

## Recreation of Personal Space
* You can recreate your Personal Space by going to "Add Personal Space".
* The new Personal Space will have **sample pages**, but any **custom data from the deleted space will be lost**.

## Limitations
* **Single Personal Space**: Each user can only have one Personal Space at a time.
* **Team Spaces**: For additional spaces, use Team Spaces, which will be covered in the next section.

# Summary

## What is a Personal Space in Confluence?

A **Personal Space** in Confluence is like your own private workspace within the larger Confluence environment. Think of it as your personal notebook where you can jot down ideas, draft documents, and organise your tasks without worrying about others seeing your work unless you want them to.

## Key Features

- **Private Workspace**: By default, your Personal Space is visible to everyone in your organisation, but you can easily change the settings to make it private.
- **Content Creation**: You can create pages to store text, images, tables, and more. It’s similar to using a word processor like Microsoft Word or Google Docs.
- **Templates**: Confluence offers various templates to help you quickly create structured content, such as to-do lists or meeting notes.
- **Navigation**: Your Personal Space has a navigation panel on the left side where you can access your pages, blog posts, and settings.
- **Customisation**: You can customise your Personal Space by adding shortcuts to frequently used websites or tools.

## Managing Access

- **Permissions**: You can control who can see your Personal Space by adjusting the permissions in the Space Settings. This allows you to keep your drafts and personal notes private.
- **Groups and Users**: You can grant access to specific groups or individual users if you want to share certain content with others.

## Creating and Deleting

- **Creating a Personal Space**: It’s easy to create your Personal Space by clicking on “Add Personal Space” in the top right corner of Confluence.
- **Deleting a Personal Space**: If you no longer need your Personal Space, you can delete it through the Space Settings. Be cautious, as this action is irreversible and all content will be permanently lost.

## Practical Uses

- **Drafting Content**: Use your Personal Space to draft documents, create to-do lists, and organise your thoughts before sharing them with your team.
- **Sandbox**: It’s a great place to experiment with Confluence features and templates without affecting the main team spaces.

> A Personal Space in Confluence is your own private area to create, organise, and manage content, with the flexibility to share it with others if needed. It’s a powerful tool to help you stay organised and productive within your organisation.
