# Collaborative Editing
* Collaborative Editing allows multiple users to edit a page simultaneously, enhancing teamwork and productivity.

## Features
* **Invite to Edit**: Users can invite others to edit a page by sending an invitation.
  * Invited users receive a notification to join the editing session.
* **Cursor Indicators**: See where other users' cursors are located on the page.
  * As one user types or moves their cursor, other users can see these actions in real-time.
* **Unpublished Changes**: Changes made by one user can be seen by others even if not published.
  * **Visibility**: Unpublished changes are visible to all collaborators but are not saved until published.
  * **Leaving the Page**: If a user leaves the page without publishing, their changes remain visible to others but are not finalised.

<br>

### Practical Example
* **Remote Meetings**: Useful for remote meetings where multiple people can collaborate on notes in real-time.
  * **Meeting Notes**: Multiple users can edit a meeting notes page simultaneously, adding their inputs and observations.
  * **Finalising Notes**: Once the meeting is over, the page can be published and shared with the entire team.
* **Team Collaboration**: Enhances teamwork by allowing simultaneous editing and immediate visibility of changes.
  * **Project Documentation**: Teams can work together on project documentation, ensuring everyone is on the same page and contributing in real-time.

## Benefits
* **Efficiency**: Reduces the need for back-and-forth communication and multiple versions of documents.
* **Transparency**: Everyone can see changes as they happen, promoting transparency and collaboration.
* **Flexibility**: Users can join or leave the editing session as needed, without disrupting the workflow

# Sharing Pages with our Team

## Steps to Share a Page
1. On the page you want to share, click the **Share** button.
2. Type the **name** of the person you want to **share the page with**. You can also share with a **group** or **team**.
3. Optionally, add a message before sending the share notification.

## Notifications
* The recipient will receive a notification in Confluence.
* An email notification will also be sent to the recipient.
* If the recipient has the Confluence mobile app installed and notifications enabled, they will receive a mobile notification as well.

## Benefits
* **Efficiency**: Quickly share pages with team members or groups without needing to send separate emails or messages.
* **Visibility**: Ensure that important pages are easily accessible to the intended recipients.

<br>

# Working with Teams in Confluence
* **Teams** feature in Confluence allows for better **collaboration** and **organisation** within your team.

## Creating a Team
Steps:
1. Click on "People" at the top of the Confluence interface.
2. Click on "Start a team" and give your team a name (e.g., Web Team).
3. Add Members: Add team members by typing their names (e.g., Brad) and start the team.

## Viewing and Managing Teams
* View your teams under `People > Teams`.
* Upload an image to customise the team page (note: there may be bugs affecting this feature).
* See all members of the team. 
  * Invited members need to accept the invitation to join the team.

## Team Activity and Links
* View team activity, including pages, comments, and edits made by team members.
* Add links to resources for quick access by team members.

## Independent of Spaces
* **Flexibility**: Teams work independently of spaces, allowing for different subsets of people to collaborate without needing to be assigned to the same space.
* **Project-Based Teams**: Teams can be used for project-based collaboration, providing a central place for team members to see recent work and resources.

### Practical Example
* **Project Collaboration**
  * Teams can be used to collaborate on specific projects, with team members seeing each other's activities and adding relevant links and resources.

## Deleting a Team
* Deleting a team will **permanently remove** all links and resources added to the team. Pages and comments in the space will remain unaffected.

<br>

# Managing Files in our Space

## Adding Attachments
* The easiest way to add an attachment to a page is by **dragging and dropping** it onto the page.
* Confluence **recognises many file types**, such as images, Word documents, and audio files, and **provides previews for them**.
  * **Images**: Automatically resisable with options to add captions.
  * **Word Documents**: Creates a preview and allows embedding directly on the page.
  * **Audio Files**: Provides an audio player for mp3 files.

## Handling Unrecognised File Types
* Adding a zip file will not generate a preview, but the file can still be downloaded.

## Updating Attachments
* Confluence **automatically versions attachments** when a **file** with the **same name** is **uploaded**.
* Access different versions of an attachment through the "Attachments" section.
* The most current version is displayed on the page.

## Managing Attachments
* Access all attachments on a page by clicking the **three dots** and selecting "Attachments".
* View all attachments across an entire space by navigating to `Space Settings > Manage Pages > Attachments`.
* Filter attachments by file type, such as Word documents.

## Practical Example
* **Adding an Image**: Dragging an image file onto the page automatically adds it, allowing for resising and captioning.
* **Adding a Word Document**: Dragging a Word document onto the page creates a preview and allows embedding.
* **Adding an Audio File**: Dragging an mp3 file onto the page provides an audio player for playback.
* **Handling a Zip File**: Dragging a zip file onto the page does not create a preview, but the file can still be downloaded.

<br>

# Page Restrictions
* Page Restrictions in Confluence control access to individual pages.

## Terminology
### Restrictions vs. Permissions
* `Permissions`: Affect **all pages** across a space.
* `Restrictions`: Affect **a single page** at a time.

## Applying Restrictions
Steps:
1. Go to the page you want to restrict.
2. Click on the "Restrictions" icon at the top right.
3. Choose who can view and/or edit the page.
4. Apply the restrictions to lock the page.

## Hierarchical Impact
* **Child Pages**: Restrictions on a parent page also affect its child pages.
  * Example: Restricting access to a root page will also restrict access to its child pages.

## Managing Restrictions
Changing Restrictions:
* **Adjust Access**: Change who can view and/or edit the page.
* **Remove Restrictions**: Remove restrictions to allow broader access.

## Notifications
* **Request Access**: Users who do not have access can request it, sending a notification to the page owner.
* **Visibility**: Restricted pages do not appear in the sidebar for users who do not have access.
