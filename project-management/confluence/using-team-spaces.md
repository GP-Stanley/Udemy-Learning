# Getting to Pages Quickly with Stars
* Starring a page is similar to bookmarking or adding to favorites in a web browser.
  
## Starring Pages
Steps:
1. Go to the page you want to star.
2. Hover over the page and click the "star" icon at the top right. The keyboard shortcut for starring a page is `f`.
3. You may need to **refresh** the page for Confluence to recognise the starred page.

## Accessing Starred Pages
* In the space, filter pages to show only starred pages.
* Access all starred pages across different spaces by going to "Recent" and selecting "Starred".
* Starred pages can also be accessed from the **Home page**.

## Starring Spaces
* The Home page of a space can be starred, which effectively stars the entire space.
* Starred spaces will show up in the **spaces drop-down menu** for quick access.

## Benefits
* **Efficiency**: Starring pages and spaces helps you quickly access frequently used content, especially in spaces with many pages.

<br>

# Using the Watch Page Feature

## Key Differences Between Starring and Watching
* Starring: Similar to bookmarking or favoriting a page for quick access.
* Watching: Provides notifications of updates to the page, such as edits, deletions, attachment updates, and comments.

## Watching a Page
Steps:
1. Click the `eye icon` at the top right of the page. The keyboard shortcut for watching a page is `w`.
2. Choose to watch either the **specific page or the entire space**.
3. Receive **email notifications** and **in-app notifications** for updates to the watched page or space.

## Automatic Watching
* By default, Confluence automatically assigns you to watch any page or Blog post that you create or edit.

## Managing Watchers
* Users with Administrative Permissions can manage watchers.
* Administrators can see who is watching a page or space and add or remove watchers as needed.

## Practical Example
* When a watched page is edited, **watchers receive notifications** of the changes.
* Notifications are sent via **email** and appear in the Confluence **notification area**.

<br>

# Task Management in Confluence
* Confluence is not a full-fledged task management tool but allows adding tasks to pages to enhance productivity.

## Creating Tasks
* Create a new page using the **To-do list template**.
* Tasks, to-dos, and actions are used **interchangeably** in Confluence.
* **Tasks** are represented as **checkboxes**. 
  * Unchecked boxes are incomplete tasks, and checked boxes are complete tasks.

## Adding Tasks
* Edit the page to add more tasks.
* Use the checkbox icon or the markdown code (open and close brackets) to add tasks.
* **Assign tasks** to team members by **mentioning them** in the task.

## Notifications
* Assigned users receive an **email notification** about the task.
* Tasks appear in the user's **Task list** in Confluence.

## Viewing and Managing Tasks
* Access tasks from the "Profile" menu under "Tasks".
* View tasks created by you and tasks assigned to you.
* Mark tasks as complete directly from the Task list or the page.

### Practical Example
* Users receive an email with a link to the task and the option to view all tasks.
* Users can manage tasks from the Task list, including marking them as complete.

## Tips
* Provide additional context in tasks to ensure clarity for the assignee.

<br>

# How Blogs Work
* Blogs in Confluence are special sets of pages organised differently from regular pages.

## Accessing Blogs
* Sidebar: Blogs can be accessed from the left sidebar.
* Enable Blog: If not visible, enable it through Space Settings > Edit sidebar.

## Creating a Blog Post
Steps:
1. Click the ""plus" icon next to Blog or use the "Create" button.
2. Select the **Blog post template**.
3. Add a **title** and **content**, then **publish**.

## Organisation
* Blog posts are organised by **date**.
* Each **space** can have only **one Blog**, but **multiple posts**.

## Editing Blog Posts
* Editing Blog posts is similar to editing pages. 
* You can add tasks, images, macros, and adjust the layout.

## RSS Feeds
* Access: Find RSS feeds under `Space Settings > Integrations`.
* Subscription: Use an **RSS client** or **browser extension** to **subscribe**.
* Permissions: Ensure **space permissions allow access to the RSS feed**.

<br>

# Importing Word documents

## Steps to Import a Word Document
1. Go to the page **where** you want **to import** the Word document.
2. Click on the **three dots**, go to "Advanced Details", and select "Import Word document".
3. **Browse** to the Word document file and **open** it.

## Import Options
* The **title** of the page will be the **name of the Word document**.
* Choose to **import** as a **new page** in the current space **or replace the current page**.
* **Adjust** the **hierarchy** if there are **subpages**.
* Handle **title conflicts** by **renaming the imported page** or **replacing the existing** page.
* Option to **split the document** by **heading levels**.

### Example
* Import the document without splitting to see the full content.
* Re-import the document and choose to split by level one headings to create multiple pages.

## Embedding Word Documents
* **Attach** the Word document to the page.
* **Insert** the Word document into the **page content**.
* Preview the Word document directly within the Confluence page.

<br>

# Exporting Pages out of Confluence

## Exporting a Single Page
Steps:
1. Go to the page you want to export.
2. Click the **three dots** at the top right, select "Export", and choose either **Word document or PDF**.
3. Depending on the macros and layout, exporting to Word or PDF may yield different results.

## Exporting Multiple Pages
* Administrative Permissions are required to export multiple pages or the entire space.

Steps:
1. Go to "Space Settings" and select "Export" under **Manage space**.
2. Choose to export as HTML, XML, or PDF.
3. Normal vs. Custom Export:
   * **Normal Export**: Generates a **PDF** for **each page in the space**, excluding Blogs, Comments, and Attachments.
   * **Custom Export**: **Select specific pages** to export.

## Practical Example
* **Single Page Export**: **Export** a **page** with an **embedded Word document** as both Word and PDF to compare results.
* **Multiple Pages Export**: **Export the entire space as a PDF**, including a table of contents with linkable entries.

## Tips
* The layout and embedded content may affect the export quality.
* Exported pages can be shared with users who do not have access to Confluence.

<br>

# Using the Confluence Mobile app
* How to access Confluence from anywhere using the Mobile app.
* (App versions), Confluence Cloud app and Confluence Data Center and Server apps are different.

## Getting Started
1. Download the Confluence Cloud app from the App Store.
