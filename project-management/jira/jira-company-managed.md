# What's the difference between Scrum and Kanban?
Scrum and Kanban are both popular Agile methodologies used to manage and improve work processes, but they have some key differences:

## Scrum
* **Structure**
  * Scrum is highly structured and follows a set framework with defined roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team), ceremonies (Sprint Planning, Daily Stand-ups, Sprint Review, Sprint Retrospective), and artifacts (Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment).
* **Sprints**
  * Work is divided into fixed-length iterations called Sprints, usually lasting 2-4 weeks. 
  * Each Sprint has a goal, and the team commits to completing a set of tasks from the backlog.
* **Roles**
  * Specific roles are defined to ensure the process runs smoothly. 
  * The Scrum Master facilitates the process, the Product Owner manages the backlog, and the Development Team executes the work.
* **Planning**
  * Detailed planning is done at the beginning of each Sprint, and the team commits to delivering a potentially shippable product increment by the end of the Sprint.
* **Review and Retrospective**
  * At the end of each Sprint, the team reviews the work done and holds a retrospective to discuss what went well and what can be improved.

## Kanban
* **Flexibility**
  * Kanban is more flexible and less prescriptive. 
  * It focuses on visualizing work, limiting work in progress (WIP), and improving flow.
* **Continuous Flow**
  * There are no fixed-length iterations. 
  * Work items are continuously added to the Kanban board and moved through various stages until completion.
* **No Specific Roles**
  * Kanban does not prescribe specific roles. 
  * Teams can use existing roles and responsibilities.
* **Work in Progress (WIP) Limits**
  * Kanban emphasizes limiting the amount of work in progress to improve flow and reduce bottlenecks. 
  * Each column on the Kanban board has a WIP limit.
* **Focus on Flow**
  * The primary goal is to improve the flow of work through the system. 
  * Teams continuously monitor and optimize the process to ensure smooth and efficient delivery.

### Summary
* **Scrum**: Structured, time-boxed Sprints, defined roles, and regular ceremonies.
* **Kanban**: Flexible, continuous flow, no specific roles, and focus on visualizing work and limiting WIP.

> Both methodologies aim to improve productivity and efficiency but are suited to different types of work environments and team preferences. Scrum is ideal for teams that benefit from structure and regular feedback loops, while Kanban is great for teams that need flexibility and continuous delivery.

# Creating Issues

## 1. Accessing the Create Button
* Click the Create button at the top of the screen.
* Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut C to create an issue.

## 2. Selecting the Project
* Choose the project where you want the issue to be created (e.g., Marketing Team project).

## 3. Choosing the Issue Type
* The available issue types are based on the selected project.
* Different projects may have different issue types (e.g., Story, Epic, Bug).

## 4. Filling Out the Fields
* The fields available for the issue are determined by the issue type.
* Provide a name for the issue (e.g., "Survey for next month's social campaign is broken").
* Add a description (e.g., "The link took me to 404").
* Optionally, add attachments or screenshots, especially for Bugs.

## 5. Creating the Issue
* Once all fields are filled out, click Create to create the issue.
* The issue will be created and you can click on it to view the Issue detail view.

## 6. Top-Down Process

# Creating Filters

`Understanding Filters:`
* **Filters** in JIRA are essentially **Saved Searches**.
* Determine what information you are trying to find before creating a filter.

`Starting a Search:`
* Go to **Advanced Search** to begin **creating a filter**.
* Use dropdowns to filter information (e.g., find all Bugs in the Marketing Team).

`Using Prebuilt Fields:`
* JIRA provides **prebuilt fields** for filtering.
* **Custom Fields** created by the JIRA administrator will also appear in the dropdowns.

`Advanced Search with JQL:`
* Use JIRA Query Language (**JQL**) for more **advanced searches**.
* Example: issuetype = Bug AND project = "Marketing Team" ORDER BY created DESC.

`Saving Filters:`
* Once the desired issues are found, **save** the filter (e.g., name it "Marketing Bugs").
* **Star** the filter for quick access.

`Accessing Filters:`
* Starred filters appear on the **left-hand side** and in the dropdown menu.
* Use "View All Filters" to find and star additional filters.

`Using Filters in Other Features:`
* Filters can be used in **Agile Boards** and **Dashboards**.
* Example: Use a filter to customise an Agile Board or create a board around a specific search.

`Editing Filters:`
* **Edit** filters to **include additional projects or criteria**.

# What are Gadgets?
In JIRA, gadgets are tools that you can add to your dashboard to `display various types of information`. They help you visualise and track different aspects of your projects and workflows. Here are some key points about gadgets:

1. **Visualisation**: Gadgets provide visual representations of data, such as charts, graphs, and lists.

2. **Customisation**: You can customise gadgets to display specific information based on your needs.

3. **Integration**: Gadgets can integrate with filters, allowing you to display filtered data from your projects.

4. **Types of Gadgets**: There are many types of gadgets available, including:
   * **Filter Results**: Displays a list of issues based on a filter.
   * **Pie Chart**: Shows a pie chart of issues based on a specific statistic (e.g., status, assignee).
   * **Burndown Chart**: Visualises the progress of a sprint by showing the amount of work remaining over time.
   * **Days Remaining**: Displays the number of days remaining in a sprint.
   * **Activity Stream**: Shows recent activity in your projects.

<br>

# Using Dashboard

## 1. Creating a Dashboard:
* Navigate to `Dashboards > Create Dashboard`.
* Name the Dashboard (e.g., "Marketing Teams Dashboard").

## 2. Sharing the Dashboard
* Dashboards can be shared with team members or kept private.

    ### 2.1 Permissions
    * **Share with a project**: Anyone with access to the project can see the Dashboard.
    * **Share with a group**: Groups are set up by the JIRA administrator.
    * **Share with the organisation**: Anyone with access to the JIRA installation can see the Dashboard.
    * **Keep it private**: Only you can see the Dashboard.

> Ensure to hit Add after selecting the share option, then Save.

## 3. Populating the Dashboard
* Dashboards are populated with **Gadgets**.
* **Layout**: Change the layout to fit your needs (e.g., one column, two columns).
* **Adding Gadgets**: Click Add a Gadget and select from available options (e.g., Filter Results, Pie Chart).

## 4. Using Filters with Gadgets
* Gadgets are **based on Filters**.
* Select a filter to determine which issues are displayed in the Gadget.
* **Example**: Use the "Bugs" filter to display all bugs in the Marketing Team project.

## 5. Customising Gadgets
* Move Gadgets around to organise the Dashboard.
* Customise the statistics shown in Gadgets (e.g., status, assignee).

## 6. Viewing the Dashboard as a Team Member
* Ensure team members have the necessary permissions to view the Dashboard.
* If Gadgets are not displaying correctly, check the share settings and filter permissions.

<br>

# Sharing Filters

## Dashboard and Filter Permissions
* There are two sets of permissions to consider: the **Dashboard** itself and the **Filters** used in the Gadgets on the Dashboard.
* Ensure **both** the Dashboard and the Filters have the **correct permissions** for **team members to view** them.

## Identifying the Issue
* If team members see an **error** on the Dashboard, it may be due to **incorrect filter permissions**.
* Example: Mary can see the Pie Chart Gadget but not the Filter Results Gadget due to filter permissions.

## Fixing Filter Permissions
* Someone with **access to the filter** (e.g., Manager, Team Leader, JIRA administrator) needs to **share the filter with the team**.
* Navigate to `Filters > View All Filters` and find the relevant filter (e.g., "All Bugs").

## Changing Filter Permissions
* Check the **current access level** of the filter (e.g., private).
* Change the permissions to share the filter with the appropriate project, group, or organisation.
* Example: Share the filter with the Marketing Team project.

## Saving Permissions
* After selecting the share option, hit "Add" to apply the changes, then "Save".
* Ensure the access level is updated.

## Verifying Changes
* Have team members **refresh their Dashboard** to see if the filter permissions are updated and the Gadgets display correctly.

### Recap
* Ensure both Dashboard and filter permissions are set correctly for team members to view the Dashboard and its Gadgets.
* Adjust filter permissions as needed to avoid errors and ensure team members can access the necessary information.

# Roadmaps in JIRA

## What are roadmaps in Jira?
A Roadmap is a tool in JIRA that helps you **plan** and **track** your **projects** visually. Think of it as a big **picture of your project's progress**.

Key points about roadmaps in JIRA:

1. **Project-Specific**
   * Roadmaps work within the same project where your issues live. 
   * This means you can only create and view roadmaps for issues within a single project.

2. **Creating Epics**
   * Roadmaps allow you to create Epics, which represent larger projects or goals. 
   * Epics can be broken down into smaller tasks or issues.

3. **Adding Child Issues**
   * You can add child issues under Epics, such as user stories, tasks, or bugs. 
   * These child issues are organised hierarchically under the Epic.

4. **Tracking Progress**
   * Roadmaps provide a visual representation of the progress of your Epics and their child issues. 
   * You can see the timeline and completion status of each issue.

5. **Sprints and Roadmaps**
   * If you are using Scrum, you can add issues to Sprints directly from the Roadmap. 
   * JIRA will notify you if the scope changes for an active Sprint.

6. **Creating Future Sprints**
   * You can create future Sprints to plan and organise upcoming work. 
   * This helps you visualise the work ahead and ensure that your team is prepared.

7. **Visualising Progress**
   * Roadmaps give you a clear visual representation of your project's progress, helping you track the overall progress of Epics and their child issues.

8. **JIRA Software Premium**
   * JIRA Software Premium offers a more advanced version of Roadmaps with additional features, but it comes at an additional cost.

9. **Exploring Roadmaps**
    * It's beneficial to explore and play around with Roadmaps to see how they can be used effectively in your organisation.

> Roadmaps are an excellent way to keep your team aligned and ensure that everyone is aware of the project's goals and timelines. They provide a clear and organised view of the work that needs to be done and help you track progress efficiently.

# Creating Issues in Bulk

1. **Accessing the Create Button**
   * Click the Create button at the top of the screen or use the keyboard shortcut C.

2. **Importing Issues**
   * Instead of creating a single issue, click the Import issues button at the top right-hand side.
   * This will allow you to import a CSV file.

3. **Preparing the CSV File**
   * Ensure your CSV file has the necessary fields (e.g., Summary, Description, Issue type).
   * Not every issue needs to have every field filled out.

4. **Selecting the CSV File**
   * Select the CSV file you want to import and click Next.

5. **Choosing the Project**
   * Specify the project where you want the issues to live (e.g., Marketing Project).

6. **Mapping Fields**
   * Map the fields from the CSV file to the corresponding fields in JIRA (e.g., Description to Description, Issue type to Issue type, Summary to Summary).
   * For dropdowns or specific values (e.g., Issue type), map the field values to ensure accuracy.

7. **Beginning the Import**
   * Click Begin Import to start the process.
   * The time taken will depend on the number of issues in the CSV file.

8. **Verifying the Import**
   * JIRA will create a filter for the imported issues.
   * Double-check the imported issues to ensure they match the CSV file.

9. **Recommendations**
    * Start by importing a few issues to ensure everything is mapped correctly.
    * Once confirmed, proceed with importing larger batches of issues.

10. **Editing Imported Issues**
    * If needed, you can edit the imported issues after the import process.

<br>

## Why would you create issues in bulk?
* `Efficiency`
  * When you have a large number of issues to create, doing it one by one can be time-consuming. 
  * Bulk creation allows you to input all the necessary information at once and import it, saving a lot of time.
* `Consistency`
  * By using a CSV file, you can ensure that all issues are created with consistent formatting and information. 
  * This reduces the risk of errors that might occur when creating issues individually.
* `Initial Setup`
  * When starting a new project or migrating from another system, you might need to create a large number of issues to get everything set up. 
  * Bulk creation makes this process much smoother.
* `Data Import`
  * If you have data from another tool or system, you can export it to a CSV file and then import it into JIRA. 
  * This is particularly useful for teams transitioning to JIRA from another project management tool.
* `Batch Updates`
  * Sometimes, you might need to update or create a large number of issues due to changes in project scope, requirements, or other factors. 
  * Bulk creation allows you to handle these updates efficiently.
* `Project Planning`
  * During the planning phase of a project, you might outline all the tasks and issues that need to be addressed. 
  * Creating these issues in bulk helps you quickly populate your project with all the necessary tasks.

> bulk creation of issues helps streamline the process, maintain consistency, and save time, especially when dealing with large volumes of data.

<br>

# Editing Issues in Bulk

1. **Searching for Issues**
   * Start by searching for the issues you want to edit.
   * Use Advanced Search to filter issues (e.g., issues created within the last hour).

2. **Bulk Change**
   * Select the issues you want to edit.
   * Click on Bulk change the issues to start the process.

3. **Choosing Issues**
   * Filter down further if needed and select the specific issues you want to edit.
   * Click "Next" to proceed.

4. **Selecting Action**
   * Choose the action you want to perform (e.g., Edit, Delete).

> Note: Deleting issues is permanent and cannot be undone.

5. **Editing Fields**
   * Select the fields you want to edit (e.g., Labels).
   * Even if a field is not shown on the issue, it may still exist and hold data.

6. **Mapping Field Values**
   * Map the field values if necessary (e.g., map "Bug" to Issue type "Bug").
   * This ensures accuracy when updating dropdowns or specific values.

7. **Avoiding Email Notifications**
   * Be cautious with the send mail for update option.
   * Uncheck this option to avoid sending notifications to everyone associated with the issues.

8. **Confirming Changes**
   * Review the changes and confirm the action.
   * JIRA will process the changes, and the time taken will depend on the number of issues.

9. **Verifying Changes**
    * Check the issues to ensure the changes have been applied correctly.
    * Use filters to find and verify the updated issues (e.g., filter by Label "Imported").

10. **Saving Filters**
    * Save the updated filter for future use in Reports, Dashboards, or other purposes.

<br>

## Why would you edit issues in bulk?

`Efficiency`
* When you have a large number of issues that need the same update, editing them one by one can be time-consuming. 
* Bulk editing allows you to make changes to multiple issues at once, saving a lot of time.

`Consistency` 
* Ensuring that all issues have consistent information is crucial. 
* Bulk editing helps you apply the same changes across multiple issues, maintaining uniformity.

`Correcting Mistakes` 
* If you realise that there was an error in the information provided for multiple issues, bulk editing allows you to correct it quickly and efficiently.

`Updating Statuses`
* When a project phase changes, you might need to update the status of many issues. 
* Bulk editing makes it easy to move all relevant issues to the new status.

`Adding Labels or Tags`
* If you need to categorise or tag multiple issues for better organisation, bulk editing allows you to add labels or tags to all selected issues at once.

`Changing Assignees` 
* If there is a change in team members or responsibilities, bulk editing allows you to reassign multiple issues to the new assignee quickly.

`Adjusting Priorities `
* When project priorities shift, you might need to update the priority level of several issues. 
* Bulk editing helps you make these adjustments efficiently.

`Preparing for Reports`
* If you need to prepare issues for reporting purposes, bulk editing allows you to ensure that all necessary fields are filled out correctly.
